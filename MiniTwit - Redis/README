    ~ What is this application about?

      A SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone. 
	  This application stores frequently used data in the cache server - Redis so as to avoid the database calls.
	  
    Right now the data stored in the cache server:
      1. Number of followers of the every user. This helps to identify the most followed users.
      2. Number of times the profile of the user viewed. This helps to identify the most viewed users.

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. Open the two terminals. One for MiniTwit and another for Mini_API. Execute these commands first
		 
         cd minitwit
         cd mini_api
		 

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory. Applicable to both the terminals.

         pip install --editable .

      3. tell flask about the right application:

         export FLASK_APP=minitwit
		 
		 export FLASK_APP=mini_api

      4. In the mini_api terminal run this:

         flask initdb
		 
      5. Also in the same terminal run this to populate the database :

         flask populatedb
	  
      6. Now you can run mini_api:

         flask run
		 
      7. The application and REST API should be running on different ports
	      
        The port for REST API should be 8080 as the Ngnx setup will lookup the service at this port.
 
        Whereas, the application can be run at any port. Suppose the port is 3000 then execute
           flask run -h localhost -p 3000
