REST APIs for minitwit application

    ~ What is this application about?

      A SQLite and Flask powered twitter API clone with application level sharding.
	  
	  There are three different shards of the database named :
		mini_api00.db
		mini_api01.db
		mini_api02.db
	
	  The REST API will select the appropriate shard and will communicate with it based on the user id of the user.
	  So, the userid acts as the sharding key.

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the minitwit.py file or
         export an MINITWIT_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install the app from the root of the project directory

          pip install --editable .

      3. install BasicAuth from the root of the project directory
	  
          pip install Flask-BasicAuth
	  
      4. tell flask about the right application:

          export FLASK_APP=mini_api

      5. fire up a shell and run this:

          flask initdb
	
      6. fire up a shell and run this to populate the database:

          flask populatedb
	  
      7. now you can run mini_api:

         flask run
      8  To configure on different port say 3000
	      
          flask run -h localhost -p 3000
